# SageMaker Processing

These are examples of how to use SageMaker processing jobs for data preprocessing tasks.

You can find the following examples:

- scikit-learn-data-processing: How to use SageMaker processors that have scikit-learn built in, use of already built containers plus extra dependencies for preprocessing jobs.

- spark-ml-data-processing: How to use Spark inside a processing job, by providing a custom docker container to be used in run time. The preprocessing script uses pyspark for the data preparation tasks.
