    "# Amazon SageMaker Processing Jobs - Using Scikit-learn to preprocess data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use a scikit-learn ready container to preprocess data, and using sagemaker sdk, we will submit the jobs to be run in the cloud. Additionally, we will show how to use scikit-learn ready containers but with additonal requirements (to manage extra dependencies) without providing an specific custom image."
