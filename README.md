# Amazon Sagemaker  - Personal Training (PachisPachis)

Repository created to learn about AWS Sagemaker, the SDK, Sagemaker features, and how to apply them.

My road to preparing for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty Exam, and mastering AWS Sagemaker.

Majority of notebooks will be a copied version from [Sagemaker example notebooks](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) with low or no additional modifications, these notebook will be mainly to test their different algorithms and features within Sagemaker. They will be separated into different folders depending on the topic or features being test, such as Ground Truth Labelling Jobs, Automatic Model Tuning, etc. The following sections listed will be the ones where I will focus first, and will add examples to them as I move on.

## Intro-to-ml

Examples showcasing simple and easy examples where ML is applied, alongside how to train, test and deploy using AWS Sagemaker SDK.

## Amazon SageMaker Pipelines

Examples showcasing the use of SageMaker Pipelines for encapsulating and managing an end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment. Most of the examples are following tutorials available at sagemaker examples github, but others, are adapted to other situations, like using local pipelines to test them.

## Amazon SageMaker Processing

Examples showcasing the use of SageMaker processing jobs for data transformation/preparation, from using ready made containers provided by AWS to using custom made (user provided) images. It also touches on using distributed processing libraries such as Spark and Dask, and how to set them up using docker images.
