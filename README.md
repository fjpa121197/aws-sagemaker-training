# Amazon Sagemaker Examples - PachisPachis Training

Repository created to learn about AWS Sagemaker, the SDK. My road to preparing for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty Exam. 

Majority of notebooks will be a copied version from [Sagemaker example notebooks](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) with low or no additional modifications, these notebook will be mainly to test their different algorithms and features within Sagemaker. They will be separated into different folders depending on the topic or features being test, such as Ground Truth Labelling Jobs, Automatic Model Tuning, etc.

Let the learning begin!
