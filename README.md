# Amazon Sagemaker  - Personal Training (PachisPachis)

Repository created to learn about AWS Sagemaker, the SDK, Sagemaker features, and how to apply them.

My road to preparing for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty Exam, and mastering AWS Sagemaker.

Majority of notebooks will be a copied version from [Sagemaker example notebooks](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) with low or no additional modifications, these notebook will be mainly to test their different algorithms and features within Sagemaker. They will be separated into different folders depending on the topic or features being test, such as Ground Truth Labelling Jobs, Automatic Model Tuning, etc. The following sections listed will be the ones where I will focus first, and will add examples to them as I move on.

## Intro-to-ml

Examples show casing simple and easy examples where ML is applied, alongside how to train, test and deploy using AWS Sagemaker SDK.


## Introduction to Amazon Algorithms

## SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning

## SageMaker Autopilot

## Amazon SageMaker Processing

## Amazon SageMaker Pipelines

## Amazon SageMaker Debugger

## Amazon SageMaker Clarify

## Advanced Amazon SageMaker Functionality

## Amazon SageMaker Neo Compilation Jobs





I will add additional folders/parts where I might want to test features or algorithms with own datasets (public or private), or a combination of all.

Let the learning begin!
